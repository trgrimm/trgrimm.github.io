This post introduces basic overviews and examples of two of the most common
multivariate statistical process monitoring
[(MSPM)](https://trgrimm.github.io/posts/2024/03/mspm/) methods: the
$T^2$ and MEWMA control charts.

Code to produce this blog post can be found in [this](https://github.com/trgrimm/t2_mewma) GitHub repository.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Both methods discussed below are *multivariate* statistical methods for
fault detection. To understand the specifics of each method, we
establish the following notation:


- $\mathbf{x}\_t = (x_{1t}, x_{2t}, \ldots, x_{pt})$ represents the
  values of $p$ different variables observed at time $t$
- $t \in \\{1, 2, \ldots, n\\}$. That is, there are $n$ time points
  (observations) where the $p$ variables are observed
- $\boldsymbol{\mu} = (\mu_1, \mu_2, \ldots, \mu_p)$ is the in-control
  (IC) mean vector
- $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ is the IC covariance matrix
- $\boldsymbol{\hat{\mu}}$ and $\boldsymbol{\widehat{\Sigma}}$ are
  estimates of the mean vector and covariance matrix, respectively

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Hotelling’s $T^2$ Chart

The $T^2$ control chart was developed by [Harold
Hotelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Hotelling)[^1] and was
the first commonly used approach for multivariate statistical process
monitoring (MSPM). The $T^2$ chart is simple, easy to use, and has been
shown to perform well at detecting large shifts, but not at detecting
small to moderate shifts or gradual drifts.[^2][^3]

To monitor new data for abnormalities, we can construct the $T^2$ chart
by computing

$$
T^2_t = (\mathbf{x}_t - \boldsymbol{\mu})' \boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{-1} (\mathbf{x}_t - \boldsymbol{\mu})
$$ 

and checking if 

$$
T^2_t > \chi^2_{1-\alpha, p},
$$

where $\chi^2_{1-\alpha, p}$ is the $1-\alpha$ quantile of the $\chi^2$
distribution with $p$ degrees of freedom.

The problem with the chart described above is that it assumes the IC
mean and covariance matrix, $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ and
$\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$, are known. **This is almost never true**.

For more realistic problems, we instead compute 

$$
T^2_t = (\mathbf{x}_t - \boldsymbol{\hat{\mu}})' \boldsymbol{\widehat{\Sigma}}^{-1} (\mathbf{x}_t - \boldsymbol{\hat{\mu}})
$$ 

and check if 

$$
T^2_t > \frac{p(n^2 - 1)}{n(n-p)}F_{1-\alpha, p, n-p}.
$$

Observations where the monitoring statistic $T^2$ exceed the upper
threshold are flagged as out-of-control (OC), and we say that a fault
occurred or is ongoing at that time.

<!-- Note: -->
<!-- : The $T^2$ statistic relies upon data only at time $t$ and therefore does not incorporate information from previous points in time. -->

**Note:** The $T^2$ statistic relies upon data only at time $t$ and
therefore does not incorporate information from previous points in time.

## Assumptions

The $T^2$ chart relies on two main assumptions:

- independence
- multivariate normality

In many processes, data is collected at a high frequency over time,
violating the assumption of independence. Additionally, many processes
with computed or complex variables may violate the assumption of
multivariate normality due to heavy-tailed or skewed data.

Mild violations of these assumptions can still yield adequate fault
detection results with the $T^2$ chart, but more severe violations
typically result in poor performance[^4].

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Multivariate Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (MEWMA) Chart

The MEWMA chart[^5] is a popular approach to monitoring multivariate
data that excels at detecting small to moderate shifts.

In practice, the MEWMA is constructed by first computing 

$$
\mathbf{q}\_t = \lambda(\mathbf{x}\_t - \boldsymbol{\hat\mu}) + (1-\lambda)\mathbf{q}_{t-1},
$$

where

- $\lambda$ is a smoothing parameter, often selected to be between 0.05
  and 0.2
  - smaller values of $\lambda$ are better for detecting smaller shifts
- $\mathbf{q}_0$ is set to 0.

Then, the chart classifies observations as OC when 

$$
p_{\text{MEWMA}} = \mathbf{q}\_t' \boldsymbol{\widehat{\Sigma}}^{-1}_{\mathbf{q}_t} \mathbf{q}_t > h,
$$

where

- $h$ is a threshold selected to ensure a desired IC average run length
  (ARL), which is the expected number of observations before the chart
  is expected to falsely classify an observation as OC when the process
  is IC
- $\boldsymbol{\widehat{\Sigma}}_{\mathbf{q}_t} = [\lambda(1 - (1-\lambda))^{2t}]\boldsymbol{\widehat{\Sigma}}$,
  which converges to
  $(\lambda/(2-\lambda))\boldsymbol{\widehat{\Sigma}}$ asymptotically.

Notice that if we select $\lambda = 1$, the MEWMA chart is equivalent to
the $T^2$ chart.

**Note:** The MEWMA monitoring statistic relies on the data both at time
$t$ and at previous time points, allowing this method to better detect
small accumulations over time than the $T^2$ chart.

## Assumptions

The assumptions of the MEWMA chart are similar to the $T^2$ chart:

- independence
- multivariate normality

The MEWMA chart is fairly robust to violations of independence and can
even perform well under moderate deviations from multivariate normality
if $\lambda$ is sufficiently small[^6].

# Examples: Detecting Shifts in Means

Examples below demonstrate the performance of each chart when detecting
three types of faults (shifts) in mean vectors during Phase II:

- isolated faults
- sustained faults
- transient faults

**Isolated faults** are when the means shift at isolated points in time
(random outliers).

**Sustained faults** are when the means shift at some point in time and
then remain shifted afterward.

**Transient faults** are brief periods of time where the means have
shifted but return to the IC mean after a few observations.

For each example below, we first generate 500 Phase I observations from
a 3-dimensional multivariate standard normal distribution. These
observations are used to estimate the IC mean vector and covariance
matrix.

Then, the $T^2$ chart and the MEWMA chart (with $\lambda = 0.1$) are
both used to monitor 200 new observations during Phase II.

## Example: Detecting Isolated Faults

To monitor isolated faults, we generate the following Phase II data:

- $\mathbf{x}_t \sim \text{N}_3(\mathbf{0}, \mathbf{I}), \quad t \in \\{1, 2, \ldots, 200\\}$

Then, we randomly replace 5 of the 200 points with draws from a shifted
distribution.

Here, the randomly selected points are $t = 34, 66, 135, 138,$ and
$179$. So, we have the following draws for our isolated faults
(outliers):

- $\mathbf{x}_t \sim \text{N}_3(\mathbf{3}, \mathbf{I}), \quad t \in \\{34, 66, 135, 138, 179\\}$

We want to see if the $T^2$ and MEWMA charts can detect these random
isolated outliers among the rest of the observations, all of which are
IC.

The $T^2$ and MEWMA charts for this data are given in the figure below.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/trgrimm/trgrimm.github.io/assets/70607091/7978208f-558f-432e-93cb-1014d0e4ef41" width="500">
</p>

Notice the following:

- all outliers are immediately detected by the $T^2$ chart and are
  flagged as OC
- not all outliers are detected by the MEWMA chart
  - the outlier at osbervation 138 was detected because another outlier
    recently occurred at 135

Recall that the $T^2$ monitoring statistic relies solely on the values
of the data at time $t$, while the MEWMA chart relies on data at time
$t$ and previous time points. As a result:

- isolated faults will often go undetected unless $\lambda$ is selected
  to be large
  - (small values of $\lambda$ give less weight to the outlier when
    computing the monitoring statistic)


## Example: Detecting a Sustained Fault

To introduce a sustained fault, we generate the following data:

- $\mathbf{x}_t \sim \text{N}_3(\mathbf{0}, \mathbf{I}), \quad t \in \\{1, 2, \ldots, 50\\}$
- $\mathbf{x}_t \sim \text{N}_3(\mathbf{2}, \mathbf{I}), \quad t \in \\{51, 52, \ldots, 200\\}$

So, we are trying to detect the change in the means from 0 to 2, where
all means have shifted the same magnitude in the same direction.

The $T^2$ and MEWMA charts for this data are given in the figure below.
Notice that the monitoring statistics for both methods quickly jump
above the threshold once the shift occurs at observation index 50.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/trgrimm/trgrimm.github.io/assets/70607091/e74f12dc-1535-48c4-b1a8-fa206e7b57a4" width="500">
</p>

We see that

- both charts detect the shift almost instantly
- the $T^2$ chart does not consistently remain above the threshold after
  the shift
  - observations with $T^2$ values below the threshold are not flagged
    even though the mean vector has shifted
- the MEWMA chart remains above the threshold after the shift
  - all observations after the shift are flagged as OC

In summary, both the $T^2$ and MEWMA charts are able to immediately
detect the shift in the mean vector. Furthermore, the $T^2$ chart does
not classify all observations after the shift as OC, but the MEWMA chart
does.

## Example: Detecting Transient Faults

To introduce transient faults, we generate the following data:

- $\mathbf{x}_t \sim \text{N}_3(\mathbf{0}, \mathbf{I}), \quad t \in \\{1, 2, \ldots, 50, 53, 54, 55, \ldots, 73, 77, 78, 79, \ldots, 130, 141, 142, 143, \ldots, 200\\}$
- $\mathbf{x}_t \sim \text{N}_3(\mathbf{2}, \mathbf{I}), \quad t \in \\{51, 52, 53, 74, 75, 76, 131, 132, 133, \ldots, 140\\}$

In other words, there is a shift in the mean vector from $(0, 0, 0)'$ to
$(2, 2, 2)'$ starting at $t = 51$ and $t = 73$ that lasts for 3
observations and a shift at $t = 131$ that lasts 10 observations. All
other observations are drawn from the IC distribution.

Plots of the $T^2$ and MEWMA charts for the data described above are
shown below.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/trgrimm/trgrimm.github.io/assets/70607091/c61e7bcc-a7c3-4523-8c8c-b86e9a8d6816" width="500">
</p>


We see that

- the $T^2$ chart detects the transient faults immediately, but the
  fault at $t = 131$ is not fully flagged as OC
- the MEWMA chart detects the first and third transient faults, but not
  the shift at $t = 73$
  - the chart flags all observations as OC during the shift at $t = 131$

# Conclusion

In summary, both the $T^2$ and MEWMA charts are great tools for
detecting faults in multivariate processes. The $T^2$ chart performs
better at quickly detecting large or isolated faults, while the MEWMA
chart performs better at detecting small to moderate faults over time.

Both the $T^2$ and MEWMA charts assume independence and multivariate
normality. In the examples above, observations were generated according
to these assumptions. However, if either of these assumptions is
violated, adjustments are required to achieve desirable fault detection
performance.

Some examples of adjustments include:

- (dependence in the data): fitting the $T^2$ and MEWMA charts to
  detrended values from a regression, machine learning, or time series
  model fit
- (non-normality): using a nonparametric control chart or a
  nonparametric estimate for the threshold (control limit).
