This post gives a simple introduction to popular modern data science technologies. In this post, we will explore features of the [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/) platform and distributed computing with [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) using census income data from the popular [Adult](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/2/adult) dataset, which is openly available on the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/).

Some features covered in this post include:

* running interactive code in Notebooks using the [Databricks Free Edition](https://www.databricks.com/learn/free-edition) platform
* querying the [Unity Catalog](https://www.databricks.com/product/unity-catalog) data lakehouse with PySpark and SQL
* using [PySpark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/index.html) to efficiently access and manipulate data

<!--A future post will demonstrate the basics of using [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/) to log and monitor machine learning model runs and setting up automated training workflows.-->

<!-- Code to produce this blog post can be found in [this](https://github.com/trgrimm/) GitHub repository. -->
